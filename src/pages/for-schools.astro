    <h3>Use cases</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      • Middle and high school student support initiatives<br />
      • SEL reinforcement and habit-building programs<br />
      • Student transition support (new school year, new campus, new routines)<br />

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:16px;">
    <h3>Pilot-ready approach</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      Start with a small pilot: defined goals, clear success metrics, and structured onboarding.
      We can tailor rollout for counselors, admin teams, and student cohorts.
