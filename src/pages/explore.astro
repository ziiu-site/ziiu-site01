  <h1>Not a chatbot. A life navigator.</h1>
  <p>
    ZiiU is built to guide students through reflection, planning, and growth. The experience is designed to be
    calm, structured, and safe—supporting ages 9–17 with clear boundaries and purposeful outcomes.

    <h3>How ZiiU works (high level)</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      <strong>1) Check-In:</strong> short reflections that build awareness.<br />
      <strong>2) Understand:</strong> identify patterns, strengths, and challenges.<br />
      <strong>3) Grow:</strong> turn goals into small steps and healthy routines.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:16px;">
    <h3>Privacy & governance mindset</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      ZiiU is built with privacy-first principles: data minimization, secure storage, and clear user purpose.
      As the platform expands, governance, consent, and transparency will remain core requirements.
