  <div class="kicker">Privacy</div>
  <h1>Privacy you can trust.</h1>
  <p>
    ZiiU is designed for ages 9–17. That means privacy, safety, and responsible design are not optional—they’re the
    foundation. This Privacy page explains, in clear language, what we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect it.

    <h3>What information we may collect</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      <strong>Account basics:</strong> name (or nickname), email (or parent/guardian email where required), and login details.<br />
      <strong>App usage:</strong> basic product analytics (e.g., which features are used) to improve the experience.<br />
      <strong>Check-ins and goals:</strong> the reflections you choose to share with ZiiU, used to provide guidance and track growth.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
    <h3>What we do not do</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      • We do not sell user data.<br />
      • We do not run third-party ads based on personal information.<br />
      • We do not allow public posting feeds by default (ZiiU is not a social network).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
    <h3>How we use information</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      We use information to: (1) provide the ZiiU experience, (2) keep the platform safe, (3) improve features,
      and (4) understand overall product performance (in aggregated form where possible).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
    <h3>Safety, moderation, and AI guidance</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      ZiiU is designed with guardrails to reduce harmful, inappropriate, or unsafe content. We may use automated
      systems and human review (in limited cases) to investigate safety concerns, prevent abuse, and protect users.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
    <h3>Parents and guardians</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      ZiiU is built with youth safety in mind. Where required, we support parent/guardian involvement and consent.
      We also aim to offer parent resources that encourage healthy use—without overexposing private reflections.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
    <h3>Data security</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      We use industry-standard security practices such as encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and access controls.
      No system is perfect, but we treat security as a core requirement and continuously improve protections.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
    <h3>Data retention</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      We keep information only as long as needed to provide the service, meet legal requirements, and keep the
      platform safe. We aim to support deletion requests and practical controls as the platform evolves.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
    <h3>Your choices</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      You can choose what to share with ZiiU. As features expand, we will provide clearer controls for privacy settings,
      data access, and account management.
    </p>
