    question: 'What is an AI agent and how does it work?',
    answer:
      'An AI agent is an autonomous software program that can understand instructions, make decisions, and perform tasks on your behalf. Our agents use advanced language models to interpret your goals, connect with your tools, and execute complex workflows automatically—learning and improving over time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need coding knowledge to use this platform?',
    answer:
      'Not at all! Our platform is designed for everyone. You configure agents using natural language—just describe what you want in plain English. The AI handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes. That said, developers can also access advanced features and APIs for custom integrations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How secure is my data?',
    answer:
      'Security is our top priority. We use bank-level encryption (AES-256) for data at rest and in transit, are SOC 2 Type II certified, and maintain strict access controls. Your data is never used to train AI models, and we offer enterprise options including on-premise deployment for maximum control.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I integrate with my existing tools?',
    answer:
      'Yes! We support 1000+ integrations including Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, Salesforce, HubSpot, databases, and custom APIs. Most integrations take just a few clicks to set up. If you need a custom integration, our Enterprise plan includes dedicated support to build exactly what you need.',
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I exceed my plan's task limit?",
    answer:
      "We'll notify you when you approach your limit. You can upgrade to a higher plan anytime, or purchase additional task packs. Your agents won't stop working—we'll never leave you hanging mid-workflow. We believe in flexible, fair pricing that grows with your needs.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I cancel my subscription anytime?',
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can cancel anytime with no penalties or fees. You'll retain access until the end of your billing period, and you can export all your data and configurations. We're confident you'll love the platform, but we never lock you in.",
  },
